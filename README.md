Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  The client is a financial institution that is looking for an application that their clients can use to interact with them.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  This client requires many layers of security to ensure that customer data is safe, and I believe I put forward a great plan to ensure that this happens.
  
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Integrating and running Maven was challenging.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  Making sure that the code itself used industry best practices to reduce the number of bugs.
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  Maven is one of the main sources to check the application for vulnerabilities.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I would like to get more comfortable with using third party tools like Maven to increase confidence in my own code.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show the plan put forward and my understanding and description of these ideas, if not so much the application of them.
